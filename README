VERSION
    Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
        use Google::AJAX::Library;

        my $library = Google::AJAX::Library->jquery;

        $library->uri
        # http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js

        $library->html
        # <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

    You can also fetch or write-out the library content:

        my $library = Google::AJAX::Library->new(name => "mootools", version => "1.8.1");

        my $content = $library->fetch;

        # Into a scalar:
        my $content;
        $library->fetch(\$content)

        # To a filehandle:
        $library->write(\*STDOUT)

        # To a file:
        $library->write("/path/to/library.js")

        # Check if a library exists at http://ajax.googleapis.com
        # This will just do a HEAD request
        $library->exists

DESCRIPTION
    Google::AJAX::Library is a module for accessing the Google AJAX Libaries
    API via Perl

    You can find out more about the API here:
    http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/

METHODS
  Google::AJAX::Library->jquery([ <version>, <extra> ])
  Google::AJAX::Library->jQuery([ <version>, <extra> ])
    Returns a jQuery library object of the given version

    If no version is given or the given version is 0, then the latest
    version (1) will be used

    You can pass through "uncompressed = 1" to get the non-compacted .js

    For example:

        my $library = Google::AJAX::Library->jQuery(1.2, uncompressed => 1)

  Google::AJAX::Library->prototype([ <version> ])
    Returns a prototype library object of the given version

    If no version is given or the given version is 0, then the latest
    version (1) will be used

    A compressed .js is not offered at this time

  Google::AJAX::Library->scriptaculous([ <version> ])
    Returns a script.aculo.us library object of the given version

    If no version is given or the given version is 0, then the latest
    version (1) will be used

    A compressed .js is not offered at this time

  Google::AJAX::Library->mootools([ <version>, <extra> ])
  Google::AJAX::Library->MooTools([ <version>, <extra> ])
    Returns a MooTools library object of the given version

    If no version is given or the given version is 0, then the latest
    version (1) will be used

    You can pass through "uncompressed = 1" to get the non-compacted .js

  Google::AJAX::Library->dojo([ <version>, <extra> ])
    Returns a Dojo library object of the given version

    If no version is given or the given version is 0, then the latest
    version (1) will be used

    You can pass through "uncompressed = 1" to get the non-compacted .js

  $library->uri
    Returns the URI for $library

  $library->version
    Returns the version of $library

  $library->name
    Returns the name of $library (e.g. jquery, scriptaculous, etc.)

  $library->file
    Returns the filename of $library (e.g. jquery.min.js, dojo/dojo.xd.js,
    etc.)

  $library->html
    Returns a properly formatted HTML <script></script> entry for $library

  $library->exists
    Returns 1 if the $library (at the URI, including the specified version)
    exists at http://ajax.googleapis.com/

    Returns 0 otherwise

    This method uses a HEAD request to do the checking

  $library->request
    Returns the HTTP::Response of the GET request for $library

  $library->fetch([ <to> ])
    Attempts to GET $library

    Returns the HTTP::Response decoded content If <to> is not given

    If <to> is a SCALAR reference then the content will be put into <to>

    This method is synonymous/interchangeable with "write"

  $library->write( <to> )
    Attempts to GET $library

    If <to> is a GLOB reference then the content will be printed to <to>

    If <to> is a filename (or Path::Class::File object) then the content
    will be printed to the filename specified

    This method will croak if $library couldn't be gotten from Google (e.g.
    404)

    This method is synonymous/interchangeable with "fetch"
