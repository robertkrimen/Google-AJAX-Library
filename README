SYNOPSIS
        use Google::AJAX::Library;

        my $library = Google::AJAX::Library->jquery;

        $library->uri
        # http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js

        $library->html
        # <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

    You can also fetch or write-out the library content:

        my $library = Google::AJAX::Library->new(name => "mootools", version => "1.8.1");

        my $content = $library->fetch;

        # Into a scalar:
        my $content;
        $library->fetch(\$content)

        # To a filehandle:
        $library->write(\*STDOUT)

        # To a file:
        $library->write("/path/to/library.js")

        # Check if a library exists at http://ajax.googleapis.com
        # This will just do a HEAD request
        $library->exists

  Google::AJAX::Library->prototype([ <version> ])
    Returns a prototype library object of the given version

  Google::AJAX::Library->scriptaculous([ <version> ])
    Returns a script.aculo.us library object of the given version

    If no version is given or the given version is 0, then the latest

  $library->name
    Returns the name of $library (e.g. jquery, scriptaculous, etc.)

    Returns a properly formatted HTML <script></script> entry for $library

  $library->exists
    Returns 1 if the $library (at the URI, including the specified version)
    exists at http://ajax.googleapis.com/

    Returns 0 otherwise

    This method uses a HEAD request to do the checking

  $library->request
    Returns the HTTP::Response of the GET request for $library

  $library->fetch([ <to> ])
    Attempts to GET $library

    Returns the HTTP::Response decoded content If <to> is not given

    This method is synonymous/interchangeable with "write"

  $library->write( <to> )

    will be printed to the filename specified

    This method will croak if $library couldn't be gotten from Google (e.g.
    404)
